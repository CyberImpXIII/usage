# Enforces the troubleshooting order: don't retry what is already known to need
# a person, and don't re-derive a recipe without reading what broke last time.
# PreToolUse hook on Bash; see ../settings.json.
# Tests: bash .claude/hooks/test-troubleshooting.sh
#
# INSTALLED INTO EVERY REPO'S .claude/hooks/, because a hook only fires when
# Claude Code's project dir is the one holding it. The source is tools/hooks
# (source/hooks/); setup installs from it, and `hooks copies` there fails when
# a copy differs from it in meaning or a repo lacks one. Change the source,
# never a copy. The `# hooks:` line above is where this file says it applies
# (tools/hooks vocab.json). Copies rather than
# symlinks: a missing hook command exits non-zero, which is read as a block, so a
# dangling link would refuse every Bash call.
#
# WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A RULE. Two documented rules that nothing enforced:
#
#   1. CLAUDE.md rule 3 on `blocked-attn`: "you are stuck; the next step needs
#      the user. Do NOT retry, that already failed." engine.js's status gate
#      refused a non-working recipe only when `allowUnverified` was absent, and
#      lab.js passes `allowUnverified: true` on every run by design, because
#      that is how a candidate gets exercised at all. So the one documented
#      "never do this" was reachable through the tool an agent troubleshooting a
#      recipe reaches for first. That is the gap this closed. Since site-scrapers
#      c6e4243 (blocked-guard) the CLI itself refuses a blocked-attn recipe
#      unless the run is attended (`--attended` or {"attended":true}), whatever
#      `allowUnverified` says; this hook stays as the earlier layer that says
#      why and names the next step. The block message states that rule, and
#      test-troubleshooting.sh pins its wording.
#
#   2. docs/diagnosing.md opens with "Check what has broken before, first" --
#      `node failures.js match <hostname>`. A second database exists purely to
#      answer that, and consulting it is a step that has to be remembered
#      BEFORE the expensive thing, which is the shape every rule here has lost
#      to so far.
#
# The two get different treatment on purpose. Retrying `blocked-attn` is
# blocked, because the answer is already known and a retry cannot produce a new
# one. Re-deriving without reading the failure history is not blocked -- a
# hook cannot tell whether it was read -- so the relevant history is PRINTED
# instead, which removes the reason to skip it.
#
# FAILS OPEN. A hook that breaks every Bash call would be far worse than the
# problem it solves, so anything unexpected here allows the command.
