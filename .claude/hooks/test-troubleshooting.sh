# The ALLOW cases are the important half: this hook sees EVERY Bash command, so
# a false positive would block ordinary work and the hook would be switched off.
#
# Fixtures come from the live recipe DB, because recipes are not committed and a
# fresh clone has none. A case whose fixture is missing SKIPS loudly rather than
# passing -- a test that passes because its fixture is absent proves nothing.
#
# One case here earns its place by having caught a real bug: `lab.js`, `engine.js`
# and `scrape.sh` all match a hostname shape and appear BEFORE the target in the
# command, so the first version looked up a host called "lab.js", found nothing,
# and allowed a retry of a blocked-attn recipe. The guard did nothing and said
# nothing, which is the worst way for one to fail.
