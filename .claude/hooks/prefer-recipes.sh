# hooks: applies_to=all
# Blocks an interactive browser call against a site that already has a working
# recipe. PreToolUse hook on the Claude-in-Chrome tools and WebFetch; see
# ../settings.json. Tests: bash .claude/hooks/test-prefer-recipes.sh
#
# THIS FILE IS INSTALLED INTO EVERY REPO'S .claude/hooks/, because a hook only
# fires when Claude Code's project dir is the one holding it -- so a rule
# enforced in only one folder is not enforced when a session starts in another.
# The source is tools/hooks (source/hooks/); setup installs from it, and
# `hooks copies` there fails when a copy differs from it in meaning or a repo
# lacks one. Change the source, never a copy. The `# hooks:` line above is
# where this file says it applies (tools/hooks vocab.json).
#
# Copies rather than symlinks: a hook whose command is missing exits non-zero,
# which Claude Code reads as a block, so a dangling link would refuse every
# matching call -- far worse than the duplication.
#
# WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A RULE: it was already a rule, in two files.
# claudeTest/CLAUDE.md opens with "Before reaching for a generic approach
# (interactive browser tools, one-off scripts, manual steps), check whether a
# tool in this folder already does the job", and site-scrapers/CLAUDE.md rule 1
# is "Check before assuming: node query.js site <target>". The whole README
# section "Why this saves tokens" measures the gap: a known site is one Bash
# call returning one JSON object, where the interactive path is a
# tabs_context_mcp call, a navigate, one or more screenshots (the single most
# expensive line item), a read_page accessibility dump that can run to tens of
# thousands of characters, and several chunked javascript_tool extractions --
# 8+ round trips for the same data.
#
# The failure mode is not ignorance, it is habit: opening a browser is the
# obvious move, and the check that would have avoided it is one the agent has
# to remember to make FIRST, before the expensive thing. That is exactly the
# shape rule 4 already lost to, which is why that one became a hook too.
#
# It blocks rather than warns because on a `working` recipe the alternative is
# strictly better and always available. When a browser is genuinely needed --
# building a second recipe for the same host, confirming a wall, an attended
# handoff -- `./dev.sh browser-ok` opens a short window. That is a conscious
# act, which is the point; a block with no way past it would be worse than the
# habit it corrects.
#
# FAILS OPEN. A hook that breaks every browser call would be far worse than the
# problem it solves, so anything unexpected here allows the call.

# Find site-scrapers by walking UP from this hook, not by assuming a depth.
#
# The first version used "../.." with a one-level fallback, which worked from
# site-scrapers/ and from the tools folder and nowhere else. Installed in
# emailTools/.claude/hooks/ it resolved to a path that does not exist, exited 0,
# and enforced nothing -- a guard that is present, reports no error, and does
# not run. Each tool folder is its own repo at its own depth, so the layout has
# to be discovered.
#
# Identified by its package.json NAME, the one thing only site-scrapers has.
# "dev.sh and engine.js" was not unique: scriptingTools/data-bridge has both
# (and a query.js), so its copy of this hook resolved to data-bridge, found no
# recipes, and allowed everything -- present, silent, enforcing nothing.

# And only a recipe that actually covers THIS host. `dev.sh known` matches
# suffixes in both directions, which is right for "what do we know about this
# domain" but wrong for blocking: a recipe on jobs.lever.co made this refuse
# lever.co/about, Lever's marketing site, which has nothing to do with the job
# board. A false positive in a blocking hook is worse than a miss -- it gets the
# hook switched off, and then it protects nothing. So: the recipe's host must be
# the host itself, or a parent of it (a recipe on lever.co may serve
# jobs.lever.co; the reverse does not hold).
#
# The recipe's host is normalised exactly as $host is (lowercased, `www.`
# stripped): `dev.sh known` strips www on both sides when it MATCHES but prints
# the hostname as stored, and db.js upsertSite stores what it is given. Compared
# raw, a recipe stored as `www.x.com` was listed by `known` and never blocked.
